# purchase_line_form_view
Usually in Odoo if you create or edit a purchase order line from the Purchases -> Purchase -> Requests for Quotation or Purchase Order form views, you have to edit the lines inline.

This is fine if your needs are basic and you have only a few fields.

As you start adding more fields, or more complex fields, you might find you need a form view to accomodate them properly.

This module adds a 'form' tag and makes the form view the default for editing a purchase order line.
